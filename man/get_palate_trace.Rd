\usage{
get_palate_trace(pal_filepath, pal_sensor)
}
\arguments{
\item{pal_filepath}{file to process Carstens AG501 .txt file, with header containing original header names) and that the sampling rate of the EMA data is 250 Hz. Note: do not use \code{\link{process_ag501}} on the palate trace file to be used as input to this function.}

\item{pal_sensor}{number of sensor used for palate trace}
}
\description{
Converts a AG501 palate trace file to Assp Data Object (note: this function is typically not used alone and is instead called by \code{\link{process_ag501}})
}
\details{
Takes a Carstens AG501 .txt file (with headers) corresponding to a speaker-specific palate trace and returns a SSFF object. This function is not designed to run alone and is instead called from \code{\link{process_ag501}}
}
\note{
At present, this assumes that the input is an unprocessed palate trace file, with the original column names (i.e. the file has not been processed via process_ag501). This is because process_ag501 on such files is unnecessary given that we only need to obtain X/Y/Z coordinates and do not require smoothing and derived variables for the palate trace
