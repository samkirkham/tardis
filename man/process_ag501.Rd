\arguments{
\item{filename}{file to process (Carstens AG501 ASCII .txt file, with header)}

\item{sensor_array}{character array of sensor names corresponding with the channels in the .txt file (this must contain a name for each channel and names should be in sequential order)}

\item{sr}{sampling rate in Hz (default=250)}

\item{filter_order}{Order of low-pass Butterworth smoothing filter (default=5)}

\description{
Process Carstens AG501 .txt and write processed data to new .txt file
}
\details{
The function takes a Carstens AG501 ASCII .txt file (with headers) and a character list of sensors corresponding to each channel in the AG501 .txt files. It then processes this file by adding user-specified column names from 'sensor_array', calculates lip aperture and various velocity measures, and saves an output file with same name to a new directory. For each sensor channel it returns the following variables for the x/y/z/phi/theta coordinates: _raw (unsmoothed), _filt (smoothed), _Vel (velocity), _VelAbs (absolute velocity), _Acc (acceleration), _AccAbs (absolute acceleration), _TVAbs (absolute tangential velocity; in xz and xyz dimensions).
